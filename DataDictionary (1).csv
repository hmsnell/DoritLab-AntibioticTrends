Heading,Description
Specimen ID,Identifier for isolate
Genus,"Genus of the bacterial isolate. This is usually based on what the submitting laboratory reported, but may be updated if identification is performed at CDC and a different genus result is obtained."
Species,"Species of the bacterial isolate. This is usually based on what the submitting laboratory reported, but may be updated if identification is performed at CDC and a different species result is obtained. Species is confirmed at CDC for all Campylobacter submitted for NARMS surveillance."
Serotype,"Serotype of the bacterial isolate. This is usually based on what the submitting laboratory reported, but may be updated if identification is performed at CDC and a different serotype result is obtained."
Data Year,The calendar year for the isolate (i.e. calendar year is assigned based off of specimen collection date). Preliminary years will be designated with an asterisk (*).
Region Name,"HHS Region is the geographic location for the state that submitted the isolate to NARMS. For more information on these regions, see the HHS website at https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/iea/regional-offices"
Age Group,"Age category (in years: 0-4, 5-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30- 39, 40- 49, 50- 59, 60- 69, 70- 79, 80+)"
Specimen Source,Type of specimen from which the isolate was obtained (i.e. blood or stool)
Resistance Pattern,"Antibiotics that were found to be resistant for the isolate; otherwise, will read ""No resistance detected"""
Resistance Determinants,"Genes or mutations known to predict resistance found through whole genome sequencing. If none were found, will read ""No determinants detected"". If whole genome sequencing was not performed on the isolate, will read ""Not sequenced"". If whole genome sequencing was performed on the isolate, but it has not yet been analyzed for the presence of resistance genes, will read ""Not analyzed""."
Predictive Resistance Pattern,"Predicted resistance pattern based on resistance determinants. If no determinants were found, will read ""No determinants detected"". If whole genome sequencing was not performed on the isolate, will read ""Not sequenced"". If whole genome sequencing was performed on the isolate, but it has not yet been analyzed for the presence of resistance genes, will read ""Not analyzed""."
Lost resistance on retest,"If 'Yes', the isolate lost resistance on retest. If 'No', the isolate was retested, but did not lose resistance."
NCBI Accession Number,Accession number for whole-genome sequence uploaded to NCBI for this isolate (assigned by NCBI)
WGS ID,Unique ID assigned by PulseNet for an assembled whole-genome sequence. Used to identify sequences uploaded to NCBI.

AMP (or A in Resistance Pattern),Ampicillin
ATM,Aztreonam
AUG (or Au in Resistance Pattern),Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid
AXO (or Cx in Resistance Pattern),Ceftriaxone
AZM,Azithromycin
CAZ,Ceftazidime
CCV,Ceftazidime-clavulanic acid
CEP,Cephalothin
CEQ,Cefquinome
CHL (or C in Resistance Pattern),Chloramphenicol
CIP,Ciprofloxacin
CIP(I/R),Abbreviation used in the Predictive Resistance Pattern field to indicate when the genetic determinants can only predict decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (intermediate or resistant MIC).

[Antibiotic]_Equiv,Equivalence operator on the test result for the particular antibiotic
[Antibiotic]_Rslt,Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC in ug/mL) test result for the particular antibiotic
[Antibiotic]_Concl,"Test conclusion for the particular antibiotic: S (susceptible), I (intermediate), R (resistant), X (no interpretation)*"
[Antibiotic]_ConclPred,"Predicted conclusion as determined by genetic sequencing (NPR - No Predicted Resistance, DS - Decreased Susceptibility, or R - Resistant. Will be blank if not sequenced or if not yet analyzed for the presences of resistance genes)"
"* The criteria used to categorize minimum inhibitory concentration results as susceptible (S),",
"intermediate (I), or resistant (R) are based on current breakpoints provided by the Clinical",
"and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), epidemiological cutoff values established by the",
"European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), or MIC distribution",
data collected by NARMS. X indicates that no breakpoints or epidemiological cutoff values,
are available.,
